			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p style="text-align: justify;">Mayo Surgical™ provides a unique range of services that are directed towards accelerating cash flow and eliminating risk for medical providers, and facilitating an efficient and risk-free connection between clients needing medical services and providers eager to expand new business. Mayo Surgical's value proposition creates a winning scenario for all participants involved in lien-based medical services, including medical providers, patients and their legal representatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mayo Surgical™ continues to expand nationwide and provides its services to clients across all parts of the country. Mayo Surgical™ distinguishes itself by underwriting "high-end" needed medical care, to include comprehensive outpatient surgical procedures or extensive surgery and hospitalization. Mayo Surgical™ does not have a "cap" or dollar threshold limitation and can always be relied upon to provide reliable funding for even the most expensive surgeries and medical procedures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mayo Surgical™ facilitates the purchase of your lien-based medical care (and Letter of Protection) for physicians, Ambulatory Surgery Centers (“ASC’s”), hospitals and other types of medical providers prior to the care being rendered. Mayo Surgical provides a full range of services to support an existing Third Party Liability Program. These Programs can be customized to meet each healthcare provider's needs and requirements, to include all necessary underwriting, risk assessment, and on-going support. Mayo Surgical's Programs are easy to initiate, have no upfront fees and produce immediate bottom-line results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Through its unique value proposition which accelerates cash flow and eliminates risk for healthcare providers, the doors of lien-based medical care are opened wider for the general public to access. Historically, many uninsured individuals have delayed or have been forced to go without needed accident related medical treatment due to the unavailability of quality healthcare providers willing to accept lien-based cases. The inherent risks of legal cases and the long-term nature of lien-based accounts receivable are formidable deterrents for medical providers in today's already difficult healthcare industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mayo Surgical™ takes pride in transforming the typically undesirable situation of lien-based medical care into a rare win-win situation for all participants - healthcare providers, patients, and their legal representatives.</p>
