<h2>What is a lien?</h2>
A lien is a legal claim on property or resources that makes it collateral against a particular debt. In the case of a medical lien, there is a lien against the proceeds from an insurance payout or proceedings from a medical lawsuit.
</p>
<h2>Why are liens important to healthcare providers?</h2>
<p>Lien-based medical care can be an important new source of revenue and reimbursement for many healthcare providers –physicians, clinics and surgery centers. It is the one area most often overlooked and least understood sources available to a patient to cover medical treatment if a patient does not have the financial means to afford the physician or care.
</p>
<h2>Why go to the bother and risk of accepting Consensual liens?</h2>
<p>A Consensual lien provides a way to strengthen relationships with other supporting providers.  It also provides a means to serve those patients that cannot pay with conventional methods. Unquestionably, providing any lien-based care does carry a degree of risk, and certainly increases expenses and work for the office staff. However by not accepting Consensual lien cases, a significant bottom-line opportunity may be lost
</p>
<h2>Is there a way to secure a Consensual lien without the risk and added expense?</h2>
<p>Yes. It is very simple. You can make Mayo Surgical™ your partner for the purpose of assessing and helping to find financing for your lien-based patients. Once we have procured financing, there are no further financial risks for the healthcare provider.
</p>
<h2>Why should I use Mayo Surgical?</h2>

Mayo Surgical's support and expertise allows for minimal impact on your business office staff. Risks are almost completely eliminated by Mayo Surgical's underwriting assessment and guaranteed payment.
</p>
<h2>Where does Mayo Surgical currently operate?</h2>

</p>
<h2>How does the process work?</h2>
<p>
Mayo Surgical facilitation process is generally initiated by the referral of a case by a physician or attorney, seeking approval for financing.  Mayo Surgical makes this possible by quickly providing underwriting and risk assessments.  In many instances, the turn-around time is just a few days. This information is transmitted to you prior to scheduling treatment, thus protecting you and guaranteeing payment for your services.  Following the patient's course of care, your office will send the patient's bills and selected medical records to Mayo Surgical. You will receive a payment within 30 days following completion of the necessary account documents.
</p>
<h2>What is the impact on my billing and collecting?</h2>
<p>When you partner with Mayo Surgical,  you are in effect eliminating the negative long-term aging impact that can be associated with accepting consensual liens. This is because the aging of the account is controlled by your billing process. Mayo Surgical™ will accept your billing and guarantee payment of the contracted amount in 30 days after the necessary account documents are completed. We further protect your bottom-line by making a ‘Without Recourse’ account purchase. No matter what happens to the lien, Mayo Surgical™ will never ask you to buy it back. 
</p>

The contracted percentage paid to you for the purchase of a lien is a simple, straightforward amount and is inclusive of all costs. There are no hidden fees or surprises when you receive payment.
</p>

<p>

It all depends on you wish to set up the procedure.

Important Information for Hospitals

Mayo Surgical™ is a national leader in the facilitation of medical care for patients who have been injured in third-party accidents and require treatment using a lien for payment of services.

Mayo Surgical™ provides guaranteed payment on lien cases for hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers in the majority of states. Mayo Surgical's clients include specialty physicians, clinics and ambulatory surgery centers, as well as individual hospitals and major healthcare systems. 

Mayo Surgical's programs provide a timely, risk-free way to increase new patient revenue while ensuring guaranteed, recoupment-free payments.

Mayo Surgical's programs have no significant impact on the facility's revenue cycle process or information systems. The programs include all necessary case assessment, underwriting, legal requirements and administrative processing and training.

The Mayo Surgical™ approach creates a true win/win partnership with the healthcare provider and the other parties involved in these highly technical and legal transactions: the patient, the attorney and the physician. The significant advantages of the Mayo Surgical Programs are numerous:
</p>
<ul class="faq_links">
<li>Mayo Surgical™ guarantees payment in 30 days of receiving consultative/operative notes.</li>
<li>The Mayo Surgical Programs are a “Without Recourse” purchase, which means Mayo Surgical assumes the total risk once an account is purchased. If a lien eventually becomes uncollectable, Mayo Surgical assumes the total loss.</li>
<li>Mayo Surgical™ provides all the necessary coordination between patient, physician and attorneys, which then relieves the hospital of its concerns of high risk, lack of resources and aversion to dealing with attorneys and the legal process. The hospital gains the additional revenue - and loses both the hassle and the risk to receive reimbursement.</li>
<li>Mayo Surgical™ enables the provider to accept patients on a lien-basis that may have previously been turned away.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the provider seeking to improve opportunities with certain important physician partners, Mayo Surgical's dedication to outreach and market development can assist the facility in strengthening and creating relationships with these physicians.  Mayo Surgical can assist in creating a high level of physician loyalty.

Mayo Surgical's Consensual and Statutory Lien purchase programs work in a completely hassle-free way that makes the processing totally seamless to staff. Smooth, efficient processing is successful from the registration point throughout the entire revenue cycle.
Our services create the opportunity to enhance a provider's community relations outreach by assisting its patient customer base in situations where personal injury patients approach the provider for guidance and direction in obtaining necessary care. The community relations impact can be significant and affect customer satisfaction surveys conducted by many facilities.

Mayo Surgical's Statutory Lien Purchase Program will offer cash acceleration and significant additional reimbursement opportunities, when treatment has been a result of trauma or accident. The criterion for such purchases is calculated on a situational basis.

There simply is no downside.  Mayo Surgical™ charges no upfront fees for its services; leaves the provider in control of the process; requires no minimum volumes of activity; has no maximum billing limitations; and offers to underwrite patients who otherwise might be uninsured or underinsured. 

Finally Mayo Surgical offers a no-hassle, guaranteed, no take-back payment – that leaves a positive impact on the Accounts Receivable aging.
