[10:51:32 AM] Streetter Vickell: Hi. I have a project I am to do for a redesign of a website... however that entire project is put on hold for another week.

[10:52:44 AM] Nordiff Technologies: okay... i am having good experience in making wP websites
[10:52:53 AM] Streetter Vickell: That's the theme. "Classic" look is what we are doing
[10:53:18 AM] Streetter Vickell: I just need the same picture, same colours, same functionality
[10:53:32 AM] Streetter Vickell: I already have the theme purchased. I just need it installed and the site setup

[10:57:23 AM] Nordiff Technologies: so you just want me to install the theme and to add the plug ins only..?
[10:58:15 AM] Streetter Vickell: Need to make sure it functions the same way as the Demo Page. Same buttons etc...
[10:59:28 AM] Nordiff Technologies: okay...
[11:00:18 AM] Streetter Vickell: I downloaded the theme. But I can't seem to find any of the pictures from the theme. Have you dealt with the themes before? Not sure why I can't seem to find them
[11:01:13 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Yes.... i have worked on these themes before this also
[11:03:08 AM] Nordiff Technologies: just send me the details and i will look into it
[11:04:55 AM] Nordiff Technologies: ?
[11:07:46 AM] Streetter Vickell: Ok. So you can setup the same pictures. Keep same content. I know there is some Lorem ipsum on many pages. That can stay, and I will replace later...

[11:08:34 AM] Streetter Vickell: So you'll complete project for $100, and do you have a time frame of completion?

[11:13:23 AM] Streetter Vickell: Great. We want it to function the exact same as the Classic demo site. I can copy and paste the text myself. Not a big deal. You can leave it Lorem ispum as long as all the buttons & pages etc.. are there

[11:30:04 AM] Streetter Vickell: Cpanel details ... which details do you require?
[11:31:07 AM | Edited 11:31:10 AM] Nordiff Technologies: I need to check the database first.
[11:31:22 AM | Edited 11:31:52 AM] Nordiff Technologies: For that i need hosting details.
[11:32:33 AM] Streetter Vickell: Domain:             adconnection.ca
    1st Nameserver:     ns8429.hostgator.com
    2nd Nameserver:     ns8430.hostgator.com
    Server IP:          108.167.189.41
[11:32:35 AM] Streetter Vickell: These?
[11:33:24 AM] Nordiff Technologies: http://smconstruction.ca/cpanel
[11:33:28 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Details
[11:35:02 AM] Streetter Vickell: Really. I didn't know you needed login into there. Let me see what I can come up with
[11:35:19 AM] Nordiff Technologies: ok
[11:36:36 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Meanwhile I will start working on it...
[11:36:40 AM] Streetter Vickell: Do you need to change anything in there or just view?
[11:37:06 AM] Streetter Vickell: I just don't know if I'm allowed to give out the password to the Cpanel
[11:37:25 AM] Nordiff Technologies: ok....
[11:37:32 AM] Nordiff Technologies: leave that for now..
[11:38:07 AM] Streetter Vickell: I can do a screenshare, and give you temporary mouse control. Would that work?

I just not know if I have approval to give out that password is all
[11:38:45 AM] Nordiff Technologies: no... that would't work..
[11:38:54 AM] Nordiff Technologies: no problem.. just leave that for now
[11:39:29 AM] Streetter Vickell: Really. Mouse control would allow you to go anywhere in the Cpanel you need to, and key in from your keyboard should you need to change things
[11:39:41 AM] Streetter Vickell: Do you want to try?
[11:40:12 AM] Streetter Vickell: And did you accept the job yet from Odes
[11:40:27 AM] Nordiff Technologies: no, not yet
[11:42:00 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Offer Accepted.
[11:42:26 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Sometimes there is the problem with the database table. Somethimes we have to clear up the things in the database.
[11:43:11 AM] Nordiff Technologies: You can give me the access of only smconstruction.ca. If there is the multisite hosting.
[11:43:32 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Or you can give me the access to the particular database.
[11:43:59 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Don't worry to share the details with me. You will not get any problem from my side.
[11:45:27 AM] Streetter Vickell: OK. well just let me know if you need the Cpanel later. I just don't know about the giving out the password. And everyone I can ask is currently a sleep right now
[11:45:51 AM] Nordiff Technologies: Ok. No problem.
[11:46:05 AM] Streetter Vickell: Ok. I am off to bed myself. Thank you for your assistance
[11:46:27 AM] Nordiff Technologies: YW :)
