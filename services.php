				<p style="text-align: justify;">The oath you have taken to help those who need medical care means a great deal to you. This is why you want to assist patients who have been involved in accidents but are waiting for their lawsuits or court cases to be settled. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could offer timely service without you or your patient having to worry about the medical bills and how and when they will be paid?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The answer is here. It is now. It is facilitated through Mayo Surgical. Mayo Surgical provides prompt payment for all approved clients. Your payment is guaranteed even if your patient loses the law suit. Mayo understands that in order to retain your patient base you need answers on reimbursement quickly. We are able to get you those answers in a short period of time. This allows healthcare providers to treat their patients when they need it most.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By allowing Mayo to facilitate care for your patient, healthcare professionals are insuring that they will be paid within 30 days of receiving consultative or operative reports and no longer need to fear never being able to recoup their fees from medical lien cases. There is no more money lost to medical collection agencies.</p>
