Here is a list what should be done to finish it.
 
- When I open "http://www.tti-stuttgart.de/tzbook/„  
when I am not logged in there is an error „Unbekannter Benutzer“ = „unknown user“. plz remove it cause… Sure the user is unknown when we are not logged in :D

- The welcome page doesn’t look well. Plz change it as I sent you.
 
- TTI Buchungssystem has a break

- TTI Buchungssystem is the headline AND as a link (unnecessary) the same about Börse

   So plz make it nice with the logo in front 2 boxes well-aligned with the same size

- when I login as „admin“ I don’t get to the welcome page I go to the administrator panel immediately. can you also take the welcome page and add „WP Admin“ as a 3rd link? (next to TTI Börse and TTI Buchungssystem)

And then it should work fine! :) 

The change of the rules can be done in a next step. Can we finish it on friday plz that I can write an invoice to the customer?
